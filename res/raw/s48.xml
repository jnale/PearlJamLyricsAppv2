    <lyrics>
You'll be.... going out with radio
Going out with disco
Going out like bacchanal
I'll be...going out with telephone
Going out alone
To the radar zone

It's all just inadvertent imitation
And I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent simulation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin' it

I'll be.... playing with my magazine
Using up my Listerine
Like Ovaltine
And you'll be...dipping in your battleship
For the latest tip
For the latest dream

It's all just inadvertent imitation
And I don't mean mine
It's all across this nation
If it's just inadvertent simulation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin' it?

If it's just inadvertent imitation
A pattern in all mankind
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin'?
What's got the whole world fakin' it? Yeah...yeah...
