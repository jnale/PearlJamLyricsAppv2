    <lyrics>
Have a drink they're buying
Bottom of, bottle of denial
Big guy,... big eye,... watching me...
Have to wonder what it sees...
(Sin...)
Progress... laced with... ramifications...
Freedom's big plunge

Pull the innocent from a crowd
Raise the sticks then bring em down
If they fail to obey... oh if they fail to obey, 

For every tool they lend us... a loss of independence

I pledge my grievance to the flag
Cause you don't give blood... to take it back again
Oh we're all deserving something more
Progress,... taste it,... invest-it-all
Champagne breakfast for everyone

Break the innocent when they're proud...
Raise the stakes,... then bring em down...
If they fail to obey... oh if they fail to obey

Pledge your grievance to the flag
Cause you don't give blood... then take it back again
Oh we're all deserving something more.

I want to breathe
Follow the scene
I want to taste
Everyone I see
I want to run when I'm up high
I want to run into the sea
I only want life.... to be...
I just want to be...
I will feel alive... as long as I am free...
