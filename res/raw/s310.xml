    <lyrics>
In the moonlight
gettin', why I ought to get back
it's a, this day is sure to relapse
it's getting closer to up-ends
in the moonlight
given two lost wings
a beautiful star, I see
a wonderful sense of feeling
in the moonlight
feel, it's a love draw nearer
darkened days, I spent in
a night bird is following you all the time
under a star-lined ceiling
in darkness, I see
all your senses revealed
in the moonlight
it's, it's the love draw nearer
darkened days, I spent in
a night bird is following you all the time
it's a love draw nearer
darkened days, I spent in
a night bird is following you
is following you
a night bird is following you all the time
