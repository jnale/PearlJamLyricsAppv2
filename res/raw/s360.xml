    <lyrics>
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you"
Birds singin' in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me

Say nighty-night and kiss me
Hold me tight and tell me you�ll miss me
'Cause I�m alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

Stars fading but I linger on
Oh craving your kiss
I�m longin� to linger till dawn
Just saying this

Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams leave all worries behind you
But in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
