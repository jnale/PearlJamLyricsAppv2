    <lyrics>
Big man stands behind an open door
Said, \"Leave your lady on the cement floor.\"

\"Got some kicks, wanna take a ride?\"
I said, \"Yeh,...\"
\"Take your pick, leave yourself behind.\"
I Said, \"Yeh,...\"

I've no fear but for falling down
So look out below, I am falling now
Oh please understand, I just need my friend
A way home.

Tried to walk, found a severed hand
Recognized it by the wedding band

\"It's okay, do you want some more?\"
I said, \"Yeh,...\"
\"You'll see dragons after 3 or 4...:
I said, \"Yeh,...\"

\"Understand, I'm not falling down\"
I said, \"Look around, the room's taller now,..\"
I can't close my eyes, cause i see the sound
In waves

In waves, lets me stay calm

If I don't lose control
Explore and not explode
A preternatural other plane
With the power to maintain.

Like a tear in all we know
Once dissolved, we are free to grow
\"What is human?,... What is more?\"
I'll answer this

When I get home.
