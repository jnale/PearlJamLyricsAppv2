    <lyrics>
Every night with the lights out, where you gone?
What's wrong?
Everytime you can try but can't turn on
Your rock song

Got some if you need it

Get it now / get it on / before its gone
Let's everybody carry on, carry on

Get it now / set it off / before its gone
Get everybody, carry on carrying on

Precipitation, which side are you on?
Are you on the rise? Are you falling down?
Lemme know, c?mon let?s go yeah!

Got some

Get it now / get it on / before its gone
Lets everybody carry on, carry on

Turn it up / set it off / Before we?re gone
Let's everybody get it on, get it on

This situation, which side are you on?
Are you getting out? Are you dropping bombs?
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve?

Precipitation, which side are you on?
Are you on the rise? Are you falling down?
Lemme know, c'mon let's go

Get it now / Get it on/ Before it's gone
Lets everybody carry on, carrying on

Turn it up / set it off / before we're gone
Let's everybody get it on, get it on

This situation, which side are you on? Are you getting out? Are you dropping bombs?
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve?

Precipitation, which side are you on? Are you drying up, are you a big drop?
Are you a puddle full of detrimental?

Got some, got some
Carry on, carry on

I got some if you need it, I got some if you need it
Carry on, let's go
