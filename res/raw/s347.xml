    <lyrics>
I'll grow when you grow
Let me loosen up the blindfold
I'll fly when you cry
Lift us outta this landslide

Where you go
Whenever we part

I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream I've dreamt about you

And from afar I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I wouldn't be the same...

I'll shine when you shine
Painting pictures outta my mind
Sun sets on this ocean
Never once on my devotion

However you are
Or far that you fall

I'll keep on healing all the scars
That we've collected from the start
I'd rather this than live without you
For every wish upon a star
That goes unanswered in the dark
There is a dream I've dreamt about you
And from afar I lie awake
Close my eyes to find I'd never be the same...
Without you
Without you...
