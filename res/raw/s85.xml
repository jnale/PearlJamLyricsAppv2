    <lyrics>
I want for to lay down, 
I'm waiting 'till sundown
I'm searching the haystacks, water is sunshine, 
Wait for the moment
The moment between us, the fire is made now, 
Harder to touch

I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right with you

Bakers dozen parades, 
Stand and debate
Out single file, nine in a row, swear if you must
Keeping your boots on, float with the now, 
Hot to the touch
Concrete underground, cast out everyday, 
The dregs of society
Underbelly, beside me, rejoice and follow thee

I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right
I wanted to get right 
With it, with you
