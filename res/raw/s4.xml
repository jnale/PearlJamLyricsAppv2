    <lyrics>
She scratches a letter
Into a wall, made of stone
Maybe someday
Another child
Won't feel as alone as she does
It's been two years
And counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed
By some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home...

She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be is weak
She could just pretend
She could join the game, boy
She could be another clone

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught me
Put me here
Don't come visit
Mother

Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
Why go home?
What you taught me 
Put me here
Don't come visit
Mother

Why go home?
(repeat...out)
