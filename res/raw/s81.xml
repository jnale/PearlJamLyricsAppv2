    <lyrics>
The mind is grey,... like the city
Packing in and overgrown
Love is deep,... dig it out
Standing in a hole alone
Working for something,.. that one can never hold
A place in the clouds.
Your place to hide oh my oh

I'm flying away, away
I'm driving away, away

Seeking new ways, before I miss it all

The TV, she talks to me
Breaking news and building walls
Selling us, what I dont need
I never knew soap made you taller

So I'm riding away, away
Hiding away, away

So much talk it makes no sense at all
My senses gone
