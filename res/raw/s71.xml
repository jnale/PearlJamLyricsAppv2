    <lyrics>
Oh he deals em off,... off the top,... ties em off...
Fills it up,... with his past,... gets carried away...
Oh half his life,... a hand me down,... wasted away...
Oh he fills it up,... with the love,... of a girl.

He,.. he left it alone,... drilled the pain,... money to buy...
How he makes his getaway...
How he makes his getaway...

Oh he chose a path,... heavy the fall,... quarter to four...
Fills his night,... with the thought,... of a girl

How he makes his getaway...
How he makes his getaway...
How he makes his getaway.
