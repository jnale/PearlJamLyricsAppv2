    <lyrics>
All in all,... it's no one's fault...
Excuses turn to carbon walls...
Blame it all on chemical intercourse.

The swallowed seeds of arrogance...
Breeding in the thoughts of ten...
Thousand fools that fight Irreverance.

The full moon is dead skin...
The one down here's wearing thin...
So set up... the ten pins.
As the human tide rolls in...
Like a ball that's spinning.

Bombs,... dropping down....
Overhead,... underground...
It's instilled...to wanna live.

Bombs,... dropping down,...
Please forgive,..our hometown...
In our insignificance

Turn the jukebox up, he said...
Dancing in irreverence...
Play C-3,... let the song protest.

The plates began to shift...
Perfect lefts come rolling in...
I was alone,... and far away, hey..
When I heard the band start playin'
On the lip...late take off

Bombs,.. dropping down...
Overhead,.. underground...
It's instilled...to wanna live.

Bombs,... dropping down,...
Please forgive... our hometown...
In our insignificance

Feel like resonance of distance...
In the blood...the iron lies
It's instilled... to wanna live.
