    <lyrics>
I should have know there was someone else
Now I'm alone I always kept it to myself
Now I believe in nothing
Not today as I move myself out of your sight
Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight

I could never go to no one else
The hurt don't show but who knows, time will tell
Now I believe in nothing but the pain
That I can't see this turning out right
Oh I'll be sleeping by myself tonight

Forever be sad and lonely
Forever never be the same
Oh I close my eyes and wait for a sign
Am I just waiting in vain?
Oh I'll be leaving love and disaster
Sometimes the two are just the same
I'm beginning to see 
What's left of me is gonna have to be free to survive

I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself
I'll be sleeping by myself tonight
