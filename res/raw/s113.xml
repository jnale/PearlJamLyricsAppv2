    <lyrics>
Yeah I been dreaming of getting along
Now I'm awake, dreaming keep it on keeping on
I catch a break, then a punch to the head
I smile big with a toothless grin.

Supersonic gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Yeah I been thinking, I already know
Nothing bout nothing, or so I have been told
I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold
I cut the crease and put the shit in the whole

Supersonic, gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear it, need to feel it loud yeah
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full
