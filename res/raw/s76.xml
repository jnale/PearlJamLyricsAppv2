    <lyrics>
Behind her eyes there's curtains...
And they've been closed to hide the flames,... remains...

She knows... their future's burning, 
But she can smile just the same, same...

And though her mood is fine today
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways


Standing, like a statue
A chin of stone, a heart of clay, hey...

And though he's too big a man to say
There's a fear they'll soon be parting ways

Drifiting away,... Drifting away,... Drifting away...
Drifiting away,... Drifting away,... Drifting away...
