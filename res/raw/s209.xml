    <lyrics>
Like an angel, fly over your house,
Like an angel, pass on wishes,
Like an angel, I will move the arrow,
Like an angel, I live alone,

I'm not livin' what was promised
I am close but cant enjoy
oh, I'm not dying
oh, I'm so tortured cos I see all
tortured and all I cannot do
tortured, all I should have done
tortured, while I occupied a man

I'm not living what was promised
I am far from glorified
oh, I'm not dying,
oh, I'm not alone

Mind is not a celestial state with idle helms of praise
time is short and I have an appointment, at noon, at noon in hell,
across the waste of space and fields of air I glide, alone at night,
oh please, please, think of me cos I'm, I am by your side
im by your side... I'm by your side
im right in front of you... I'm by your side
