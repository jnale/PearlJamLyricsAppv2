    <lyrics>
If I keep holding out,... will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof,... it's only rain that I feel
I've been waiting out the days,... Come Back.

I have been planning out,... All that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away,... Know that I still remain true
I've been wishing out the days,..

Please say, that if you hadn't of gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are,.... Come Back.

And these days, they linger on
And I'm the night, as I'm waiting on
The real possibility I may meet you in my dream
I go to sleep

If I don't fall apart,.... will the memories stay clear
So you had to go,......... and I had to remain here

But the strangest thing to date
So far away
And yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way

There must be an open door
For you to
Come Back

And the days, they linger on
And every night, what I'm waiting for
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dream

And sometimes you're there
And you're talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me

And it's okay.

It's okay.
It's okay.

I'll be here
Come Back
Come Back

I'll be here
Come Back
Come Back

I'll be here
Come Back
Come Back
