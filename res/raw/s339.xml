    <lyrics>
When I walk beside her
I am the better man
When I look to leave her
I always stagger back again
Once I built an ivory tower
So I could worship from above
And when I climbed down to be set free
She took me in again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When she comes to greet me
She is mercy at my feet
When I see her pin her charm
She just throws it back again
Once I dug an early grave
To find a better land
She just smiled and laughed at me
And took her blues back again

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

When I go to cross that river
She is comfort by my side
When I try to understand
She just opens up her eyes

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

Once I stood to lose her
When I saw what I had done
Bound down and flew away the hours
Of her garden and her sun
So I tried to warn her
I'll turn to see her weep
Forty days and forty nights
And it's still coming down on me

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world

There's a big
A big hard sun
Beaten on the big people
In the big hard world
