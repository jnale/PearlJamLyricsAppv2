    <lyrics>
How good is he?
how warm are his eyes
you'll see it's not a reprise
did he arrive
too late and too tethered away
to put on his suit and his tie?

How good is he?
how warm is his heart
or ego telling him which place to park
did he relate, the message is clearly hardly
grounds for dismissal outright
grounds for dismissal outright

I wake up and wait up
when anger's in fashion
I wake up and wait up
it echoes through the mansions
I wake up and wait up
when april's in may, oh uh oh
I wake up and wait up
the answers are fatal
the answers are fatal

when I wait up and wake up
the answers are fatal
if he's truly out of sight
is he truly out of mind?
if he's truly out of sight
