    <lyrics>
All the thoughts,... You never see,... You're always thinking,...
Brain is wired,... Brain is deep,... Oh are you sinking?,...

Feel the path of every day,... Which road you taking?,...
Breathing hard,... and Making hay,... Yeah this is living,...

Look for love and evidence,... That you're worth keeping,...
Swallowed whole in negatives,... It's so sad and sickening,...

Feel the air up above,... A pool of blue sky,...
Fill the air up with love,... Oh Black w/starlight,...

Feel the sky blanket you,... With gems and rhinestones,...
See the path cut by the moon,... For you to walk on,...
For you to walk on,...

Nothing left,... Nothing left,...
Nothing there,... Nothing left,...

See the path cut by the moon,... For you to walk on,...
See the waves on distant shores,... Awaiting your arrival,...

Dream the dreams of other men,... You'll be no ones rival,...
Dream the dreams of others then,... You will be no ones rival,...
You will be no ones rival,...

A distant time,... A distant space,... That's where we're living.,..
A distant time,... A distant place,... So what you giving?,...
What you giving?
