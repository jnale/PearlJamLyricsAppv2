Got a gun, fact I got two
That's ok man, cuz I love god
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly, when armed

Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun

Don't think, dumb is strength
Never shot at a living thing
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly, when armed

Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Glorified version of a...

Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded

Kindred to be an American...

Life comes...I can feel your heart...
Life comes...I can feel your heart through your neck...
Life comes...I can feel your heart through your neck...
Like some...I can steal your heart from your neck...

Glorified...glorified...
