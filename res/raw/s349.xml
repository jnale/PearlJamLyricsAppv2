    <lyrics>
I've got our love to remember
that will never change 
I have you in my head 
and no, I'll never hold you 
and I'm still asking why 
I guess that this is goodbye 

my dreams suddenly seem so empty 
I could go on my own, but I feel like playin' dead 
and for what feels like the first time 
I don't know where you are tonight 
I guess that this is goodbye 

we lived half our lives together 
a hundred years is a lot of weight to bear 
and the sun, it may be shining 
there's an ocean in my eyes 
cause I know that this is goodbye 
cause I know that this... is goodbye
