    <lyrics>
I'm falling harder then
I've ever fell before
Im falling fast while hoping
I'll land in your arms
Cause all my time is spent here
Longing to belong to you

I dream of circles perfect
eyes within your face
My hearts an open wound
that only you'd replace
And though the moon is risin
can't put your picture down
Love can be frightning when you fall

And when the time is right
I hope that you'll respond
Like when the wind gets tired
the ocean becomes calm
I may be dreaming but
I'm longing to belong to you
