    <lyrics>
It's no shame that
Love's a game that
I can only play with you
what I'm saying
is I'm here waiting for you

I've seen the light
I'm satisfied that
the brightest star thats you
Satelite I'm holding tight
Beaming back to you

Days turn into
Night turns into
Days turn into today
Don't think I'm out playin
cause I'm inside wating for you

I've felt the light
I'm satisfied that
the highest high is you
Satelite I'm holding tight
Beaming back to you

Don't you worry
I beleive your story
You were put away
for something you didn't do
But I'm waiting
I've been saving my love...
