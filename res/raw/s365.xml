Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens
Hear the circus, so profound
I hear the sirens
more and more in this here town

Let me catch my breath to breathe
and reach across the bend
Just to know we are safe
I am a grateful man
This life has been a light
and I can see clear

How to take your hand, and feel your breath
or feel this someday will be over
I hold you close, so much to lose
knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care before you were here
I danced with laughter
with the ever-after
But all things change. Let this remain.

Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
Oh every choice, mistake I've made, it's not my plan
to send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I'll wait, I'll understand

It's a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much,
I can get overwhelmed by the grace by which we live
our lives with death over our shoulder

Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I study your face, the fear goes away

It's a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get overwhelemed
by the grace by which we live
our lives with death over our shoulders
Want you to know that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I study your face, and the fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away
