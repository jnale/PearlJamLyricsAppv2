    <lyrics>
Lonely cliffs and waterfalls
If no one sees me, I'm not here at all
You could be the one to liberate me from the sun
So please, give the moon to me
I'd be indebted to ya
Walk the dog and pay rent to ya
If you say the word, I'm yours
Oh sure...
Nothing ever goes my way
But with you here, that all will change
Suddenly I'm a new born child
And I'm ready to live a while with you
So much left to do

And so I thank you dearly
For letting me see clearly
Open up, she said
Be true, be you
I'm at home in my own skin
I'm like an ocean's tide come in
Yes you could be the one to hold my hand
beneath the full moon
You could be the one
You're true, you're true
You're true, you're true
You're true...
