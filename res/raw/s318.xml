    <lyrics>
I was doom riding on top a black horse
whatever prize there was
I could only observe where the trouble starts
where does it end?
I cannot be cured
before it ends

I know life would be different if I held on (held on)
I know I could be something if I held on

Gave her love away
put it in my pocket when it should've been framed
oh, it lost its shine
gotta get this out of my head
out of my brain
how could it end,
end like this?
how could it end?

I know life would be different had I held on (held on)
I know I could be something had I held on (held on)
I know I could be something if I held on (held on)
I know life would be different if I held on (held on)

held on
held on, if I held on
held on, if I held on
held on, if I held on
held on
