    <lyrics>
Troubled souls unite, we got ourselves tonight
I am fuel, you are friends, we got the means to make amends
I am lost, I'm no guide, but I'm by your side
I am right by your side...

Young lover I stand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Take my fucking hand
It was their idea, I proved to be a man
Will myself to find a home, a home within myself
We will find a way, we will find our place

Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my fuckin' face
Drop the leash, drop the leash

Drop the leash, we are young
Drop the leash, we are young
Get outta' my fuckin' face...
Drop the leash, drop the leash...
Get outta' my, my...

Delight, delight, delight in our youth...
Get outta' my fuckin' face...
