    <title>Tonight You Belong To Me</title>
	<composer>Rose/David</composer>
    <lyrics>
I know (I know) you belong
To somebody new
But tonight
You belong to me

Although (although) we're apart
You are a part of my heart
But tonight
You belong to me

Wait down by the stream
How sweet it will seem
Once more just to dream in
The moonlight
My honey I know
With the dawn
That you will be gone
But tonight
You belong to me

But tonight
You belong
To me
