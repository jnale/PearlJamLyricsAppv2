    <lyrics>
The sirens scream wanton attention
Time to take heed and change direction
Time to take stock and make omissions

Evacuation.... Evacuation...

Time to take leave of formal functions
Time to plant seeds of reconstruction
No time, this time, to feign reluctance

It's like you're waiting for a diamond shore to wash your way
Bets put aside, you're evil
Let's crawl into your face
A vision, vague or not, raising a frightful wake-you-up

Time for... Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation...
Evacuation...

Evacuation... Evacuation...

There was a solemn man who watched his twilight disappear
(In the sand)
Altered by a fallen eagle, a warning sign..
(Sign)
He sensed worry could be strength, with a plan he said 

Time for...Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation...
Evacuation...

Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation...
Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation... Evacuation...
