    <lyrics>
Oh please don't go out on me, don't go out on me now
Never acted up before, don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted, just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you, just passing it on
Go...fuck...
Once fastened, servile, now you're getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly, with such disarm
I pulled the covers over him, shoulda' pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis...a fool, not a fucking god
No...time...suck...my...

Please...
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please...oh...

Suck...blood...touch...please, 
tunnel vision...tuck...time...see...
Please, please, please...
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please...
Don't you want me
Don't go on me
Please...
Don't go on me
