    <lyrics>
She won't get out of bed, shake her snaky hair
Grab her, throw her in the tub, she says, "Coffee and a piece of pie"
She never wears a dress on Sunday or any Monday afternoon
This is no goddamn country to wander alone

Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll

People turn their heads, she scares little kids
Eyes narrow, jaw is set, she'll fix you with a stare
She keeps her body hidden, let's her eyes make her bid
I'd wrap her up in a bullet and shoot her round the world

Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll

She won't get out of bed, shake her snaky hair
Grab her, throw her in the tub, she says, "Coffee and a piece of pie"
She never wears a dress on Sunday or any Monday afternoon
This is no goddamn country to wander alone

Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll
