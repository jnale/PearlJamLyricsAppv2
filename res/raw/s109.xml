Johnny Guitar Watson staring at me
Riding on 3 wheels, a woman on his knee
With a leg under a red dress I wish I could see
Further North a warmth alive and lingering

Now Johnny he be having lots of women
Oh The reason he be smiling known to him

On the left the girl in red so innocent
Never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed
The type of girl responsible foriginal sin
Can?t help but wonder where and who she is

And the memory is always getting clearer
For that's 30 years or more I've loved her so
And how I need to know,.. Why she?s with him

And I sleep with the light on,.. In case she comes
And I sleep with the light on,.. In case she

Recently as I was waiting on a dream
She came to visit lost and lonely me
She leaned over the bed and with her lips above my head
She asked if I had seen her Johnny

Oh and I hide my disappointment
Cause for years I had been hoping
Oh yeah I had been hoping
That when she came, she would come for me

I hide my disappointment
Cause for years I had been hoping
that when she came,
she'd be coming just for me
