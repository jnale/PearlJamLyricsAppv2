    <lyrics>
Bee girl, you're gonna die
You don't wanna be famous, you wanna be shy
Do your dances alone in your room
Becoming a star will become your doom
Bee Girl, be a girl... (2x)

You know time is long, and life is short, begin to live while you still can
Believe in nothing, believe me, those who can be trusted can change their mind
The anxious is the present, unwrap your gifts, take your time
Everything you imagined, needn't be stuck in your mind
Bee Girl, be a girl (2x)
