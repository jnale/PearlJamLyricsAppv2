    <lyrics>
Through the sleepless nights
I cry for you
And wonder who
Is kissing you
These sleepless nights
Will break my heart in two

Somehow, through the days
I don't give in
I hide the tears
That wait within
But then through sleepless nights
I cry again

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be, please let it be
My love, please end these
Sleepless nights for me

Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?

I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be, please let it be
My love, please end these
Sleepless nights for me
My love, please end these
Sleepless nights for me
