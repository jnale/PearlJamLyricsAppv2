State of love and trust
as I busted down the pretext
sin still plays and preaches
but to have an empty court, uh huh
and the signs are passin, grip the wheel
can't read it
sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands...hands yeah
and I listen for the voice inside my head
nothin', I'll do this one myself

lay her down as priest does
should the lord be acountin'
will be in my honour, make it pain
painfully quick, uh huh
promises are whispered 
in the age of darkness
want to be enlightened 
like I want to be told the end...end, yeah
and the barrel shakes 
aimed directly at my head
oh, help me, help me from myself
and I listen yeah, from both 
sides of the bed
nothin', I'll do this one myself
oh oh oh myself....Myself

yeah, yeah

hey, na-na-na-na, hey that's something
hey, na-na-na-na, hey that's something
hey, na-na-na-na, hey that's something
wanna back, back it away , yeah

and I listen, yeah, 
for the voice inside my head
nothin', I'll do this one myself
oh, ah, and the barrel waits, 
trigger shakes
aimed right at my head
won't you help me
help me from myself

eh oh eh o ehh
eh oh eh o ehh

state of love
