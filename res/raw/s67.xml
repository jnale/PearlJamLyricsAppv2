    <lyrics>
I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules..
I've deciphered tricks at the bar...
But now you're gone,... I haven't figured out why...
I've come up with riddles... and jokes about war...
I've figured out numbers and what they're for...
I've understood feelings.. and I've understood words...
But how could you be taken away?...

And wherever you've gone...and wherever we might go...
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...
We were but stones,... your light made us stars

With heavy breath,... awakened regrets...
Back pages and days alone that could have been spent, 
Together... but we were... miles apar...t
Every inch between us becomes light years now...
No need to be void,... or save up on life...
You got to spend it all.....

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...
It don't seem fair...you seemed to like it here...
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar
We were but stones,... your light made us stars

And wherever you've gone... and wherever we might go...
It don't seem fair...today just disappeared...
Your light's reflected now,... reflected from afar...
We were but stones,... your light made us stars
