    <lyrics>
Oh please, let it rain today
This city is so filthy, like my mind in ways 
Oh, was a time, like a clean, new taste 
Smiling eyes before me, inches from my face 
Wash my love (2x) 

Wash my love, yeah... 

Sin the sale, buying just a need 
Just who planted, all the devils seeds 
And what the truth, and the truth that lies at home 
It's on the inside, and I can't get it off, yeah... 
Wash my love (2x) 
Wash my love, yeah... 

What's clean is pure, but hey, I'm white on the outside, though I stray 
What she don't know today, might kill us both tomorrow, bring it back someway 
Bring it back, bring it back, back to the clean form, to the pure form 
Wash my love (8x) 
Ooh...
