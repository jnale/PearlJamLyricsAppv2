    <lyrics>
Oh, what you say, what you say, what you gonna say when your life ends?
What you gonna say? Ol&#233;!
Ah, what you say, what you say, what can you say of importance?
What you gonna say but Ol&#233;!?
Ah, what you say, what you say when there's too much you can't breathe in?
What you gonna say but Ol&#233;!?

I ain't got words for what goes on
I ain't got words for all that's wrong
What do you say? Meditate
Meditate, Ol&#233;!

What you say when they give the guy the go-ahead?
What you gonna say? Ol&#233;!
What you say, what you say when your spitting up on your bed?
What you gonna say? Ol&#233;!
What you say, what you say when you've had enough of knuckleheads
What you gonna say? Ol&#233;!
What you say, now, what you say when you've seen enough bloodshed?
What you gonna say? Stop!

I still can't help but wonder why
I'm feeling laughed at by the sky
What do you say, meditate?
Meditate, Ol&#233;!

When your life ends
When your life ends
When your life ends
