    <lyrics>
All the photographs are peeling
and colors turn to gray, he's stayin'
in his room with memories for days, he faced
an undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced
by the loss of one he could not replace

And there's no reason that she'd pass
and there is no god with the plan, it's sad
and his holiness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad

The door swings through a passing fable
a fate we may delay, we say
holding on, to live within our embrace
eleven nights, he laid in bed
hoping that dreams would bring her back, it's sad
and his holiness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad

Holding his last breath, believing
he'll make his way
but she's not forgotten
he's haunted
he's searching for escape

If just one wish could bring her back, it's sent
and his holiness is proof, it's sad
he will always love you, it's sad
