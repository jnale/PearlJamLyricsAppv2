    <lyrics>
Heading South a compass reads
Look at our speed, we're going sixty-three
Look out the window as the trees go green
I look at them and they look at me

Got Neil Young on the stereo
He comes along whenever I go
Something different as I hear him now
Heading south on a familiar route (Oh yeah)

I can feel them lifting up my blues
I can see a white horizon, new
Got the feeling I just cant lose
Rolling into Santa Cruz (yeah)

I've got an old friend he remembers me
From way back when we were seventeen
We got kids and we're older now
But when I see him, we're still seventeen

I need the beach to set me free
I need the wind to make me breathe
I need the water to wash my soul
I need my love once to let me go

I can feel them lifting up my blues
I can see a white horizon blue
Got the feeling that I just cant lose
Rolling into Santa Cruz (Ah yeah)

(Ah ha)

Up in the North West, we got it good
Little soggy, but we've got it good
Can't help thinking that I wish I would
Move my ass down to Santa Cruz

I got the feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz
I got a feeling that I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz (Oh)

I got a feeling I don't want to lose
Pulling into Cruz
I got a feeling I just can't lose
Pulling into Santa Cruz (Yeah)

(Yeah, yeah, ah, ah, nah nah)
