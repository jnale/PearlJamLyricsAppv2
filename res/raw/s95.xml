    <lyrics>
Consider me an object. Put me in a vacuum.
Free of all conditions. Free of air and friction.

Yeh, I'll be hanging upside down. An there I will swing.
For all eternity.

Feel it rising,... Yeh, next stop falling
Feel it rising,... Comatose, with no fear of falling

Consider me an abcess. Leave me in my vacuum.
Blood on all the pistons. Running my transmission

Feel it rising,... Yeh, next stop falling
Feel it rising,... Comatose, with no fear of falling

Feel it rising,... Yeh, next stop falling
Feel it rising

High above,... I'll break the law,... If it's illegal
To be in love,... Leave the hatred,.. On the cross

Yeh, I'll be hanging upside down. And there I will swing.
For all eternity.

Feel it rising,... Yeh, next stop falling
Feel it rising,... Comatose, with no fear of falling

Feel it rising,... Yeh, next stop falling
Feel it rising

Something never thought you'd be part of.
