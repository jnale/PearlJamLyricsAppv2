    <lyrics>
More than you know, more than you know
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether I'm right, whether I'm wrong
I need you so
More than you know, more than you know

Loving you the way that I do
There's nothing I can do about it
And a little bit of love that I get
May be all that you can give
But I can't live without it

Oh how I'd cry, oh how I'd cry
If you got tired and said, "Goodbye"
More than I'd show
More than you'd ever, ever know
More than you know
More than you'd ever, ever know
More than you know
