    <title>Let Me Sleep</title>
	<composer>Vedder/McCready</composer>
    <lyrics>
Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet
Heaven knows nothing of me
I'm lost, nowhere to go
Oh, when I was a kid...oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time


Flowered winds was where I lived
Thought you burned, not froze for your sins
Oh, I'm so tired, and cold
Oh, when I was a kid...oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time
Oh...oh, when I was a kid...oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's Christmas time


Oh...oh, when I, if I was a kid...oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me dream, it's Christmas time
