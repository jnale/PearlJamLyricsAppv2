Dirty Frank Dahmer, he's a gourmet cook, yeah
I got a recipe for insane soup, yeah
Wanted a pass, so she relaxed... 
Now the little groupie's getting chopped up in the back 
I Got a cupboard full of fleshy fresh ingredients 
A very careful at the same time quite expedient 
Eats meat, a release... 
Bus driving's harder on your head than on your feet 
Dirty frank (4x) 

Keeps it clean, a keeps it copacetic 
A little boys and girls, their heads are all collected 
A not crazy, a per se... 
Just a little strange, when he gets hungry 
City, state, your town, he will continue 
A stadiums, tiny clubs, every venue 
His bus, your trust... 
There goes another turned into crust 
Dirty frank...a Dirty Frank, yeah... (2x) 
Yeah...oh, watch it... 

Middle of the night, we're stopped, the freeway shoulder
A Frank's shoveling to bury the leftovers 
They're sunk, he's drunk... 
Now he's gonna drive, I'm hiding in my bunk, oh... 
The band all knows, we're too afraid to mention 
Don't want to be part of frank's luncheon
A-lose weight, a-be safe... 
Where's Mike McCready?
My god, he's been ate! 
Dirty frank...a Dirty Frank, yeah... (2x) } (2x)
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, yeah }

Why that Dirty Frank was a bad mother...Shut your mouth! 
Hey, I'm just talking about Dirty Frank

OK, I think that's enough...
