    <lyrics>
Spin me round, roll me over, fuckin' circus
Stab it down, one-way needle, pulled so slowly

Drains and spills, soaks the pages,
fills their sponges

It's my blood
It's my blood

Paint Ed big...turn Ed into...
one of his enemies...

It's my blood
It's my blood
It's my blood

Stab it down, fill the pages, 
suck my fuckin' life out, man

Maker of my enemies...

Take...my...
