    <lyrics>
Don't need a helmet, got a hard, hard head
Don't need a raincoat, I'm already wet
Don't need a bandage, there's too much...blood...
After a while, seems to roll right off...hmm...

Whipping,...they're whipping,...
...They're whipping, ah...they're whipping...
Don't need a hand, there's always arms attached
Oh, don't get behind, I can't fall back
Why must we trust all these rusted rails?
They don't want no change we already have
They're whipping,...they're whipping,...
...They're whipping,...they're whipping...

Don't mean to push, but I'm being shoved!
Ohh, I'm just like you, think we've had enough
I can't believe a thing they want us to...oh...
Oh, we all got scars, they should have 'em too...
Oh, they're whipping,...they're whipping,...
...They're whipping,..they're whipping...
They're whipping,...they're whipping,...
...They're whipping...yeah...they're whipping...
