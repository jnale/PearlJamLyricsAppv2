    <lyrics>
I shut and locked the front door
No way in or out
I turned and walked the hallway
And pulled the curtains down
I knelt and emptied the mouth of every club around
But nothing's sound, nothing's sound

I'd stay but my last tab left me
Ignored all my rounds
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls
They were upside down

I swallow my words to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I..
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving
I surfaced when all of my pen wasn't writing

I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding

It's been about three days now
Since I've been aground
No longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now
It's funny when things change so much
It's all state of mind

I swallowed my words to keep from lying
I swallowed my face just to keep from biting I, I...
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, I was diving
I surfaced and all around me was enlightened
Now I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding

I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
I'm in hiding
