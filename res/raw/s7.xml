    <lyrics>
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards you
Know something's left
And we're all allowed 
to dream of the next 
Oh the next... time we touch...

You don't have to stray
Two oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring...
The sea will rise...
Please stand by the shore...

I will be...
I will be...
There once more...
