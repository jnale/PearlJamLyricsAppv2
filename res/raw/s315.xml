    <lyrics>
Every beach has a clown who thinks he knows it all 
(hang-ten outta santa fe when surf comes out tomorrow lets go)
and he's always practicing his cowabunga call (cowabunga)
but he'll never scramble when the big waves start to roll
cause there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control

gremmie out of control
gremmie out of control
there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control

the kids always know that gremmie's talk is cheap
(ride the hula-han over the pipeline bonsai to the saddle bowl)
oh they just try to ignore this ugly creep (cowabunga)
his board is always full of dings
cause he's always doing stupid things
and there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control

gremmie out of control
gremmie out of control
there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
gremmie out of control
gremmie out of control
there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
there's nothing worse than a gremmie out of control
