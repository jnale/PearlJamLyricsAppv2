    <lyrics>
Yesterdays, how quick they change
All lost and long gone now

It's hard to remember any thing
Moving at the speed of sound
Moving with the speed of sound

And yet I'm still holding tight 
To this dream of distant light
And that somehow I'll survive

But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a sun,.. that just don't come

Can I forgive what I
Cannot forget
And live a lie
I could give it one more try

Why deny this drive inside?
Just looking for some peace

Everytime I get me some 
It gets the best of me
Not much left you see

And yet I'm still holding tight
to this dream of distant light
and that somehow I'll survive

But this night has been a long one
Waiting on a word,.. that never comes

A whisper in the dark
Is that you or just my thoughts?
Wide awake and reaching out

It's gone so quiet now
Could it be I'm farther out?
Moving faster than the speed of sound
