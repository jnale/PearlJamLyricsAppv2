    <lyrics>
Know a man...his face seems pulled and tense...
Like he's riding on a motorbike... in the strongest winds
So I approach with tact... suggest that he should relax...
But he's always moving much too fast...

Said he'll see me on the flipside... of this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been takin'... too much on... off he goes
With his perfectly... unkept clothes... there he goes...

He's yet to come back...but I've seen his picture
Doesn't look the same up on the rack...we go way back...

I wonder bout his insides...
Its like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken... where? I don't know... off he goes
With his perfectly... unkept hope... there he goes...

And now I rub my eyes... for he has returned
Seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned...
For he still smiles... and he's still strong
Nothing's changed, but the surrounding bullshit... that has grown

And now he's home... and we're laughing...
like we always did... my same old... same old friend

Until a quarter-to-ten... I saw the strain creep in...
He seems distracted and I know just what is gonna happen next

Before his first step... he is off again
