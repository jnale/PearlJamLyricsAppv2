    <lyrics>
Sorry is the fool who trades his soul for a corvette
Thinks he'll get the girl, he'll only get the mechanic
What's missing? He's living a day he'll soon forget

That's one more time around,... the sun is going down
The moon is out, but he's drunk and shouting, 
Putting people down...he's pissing,.. he's living...
A day he'll soon forget

Counts his money every morning
The only thing that keeps him horny
Locked in a giant house, that's alarming
The townsfolk,... they all laugh

Sorry is the fool who trades his love for high-rise rent
Seems the more you make, equals the loneliness you get
and it's fitting,... he's barely living,... a day he'll soon forget

That's one more time around,... there is not a sound
He's lying dead clutching Benjamins,... never put the money down
He's stiffening,... we're all whistling...
A man we'll soon forget
