    <lyrics>
I used to be a crustacean
In an underwater nation
and I surf in celebration
Of a billion adaptations

Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.

I feel the need
Planted in me
Millions of years ago
Can't you see
The oceans size?
Defining time
And tide
Arising
Arms laid upon me
Being so kind
To let me ride

I scream in affirmation
Of connecting dislocations
And exceeding limitations
Be achieving levitation

Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.
Got me a big wave, ride me a big wave, got me a big wave.

Got me a ride.
I got me a ride.
