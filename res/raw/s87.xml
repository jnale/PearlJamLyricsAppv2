    <lyrics>
Tell me what I wanna hear
This shits too good to be true
My dear

Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me

Help me

Storybook keeps from hurting me
You see
Shell of the man from the sea

Tell me lies
Tell me lies, tell me
Tell me lies, tell me

Tell me why
Tell me why, tell me
Tell me why, tell me

Tell me lies,...

Help me

Reservoir
Of hate and fear
Invisible
In repair
A hundred thieves
Cast a spell
This is hell

Help me

The man they call my enemy, I've seen his eyes
He looks just like me, a mirror

The more you read, we've been deceived
Everyday it becomes clearer,...

Clearer.

Not my enemy,.. no, not my enemy,..
Don't speak for me. No, not my enemy.
