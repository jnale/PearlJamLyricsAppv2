    <lyrics>
I saw the light - today (x4)

Silence loud and wind so (long??)
The quiet building in the dark

Surrender to the game
I saw the light today

The silent scream that we're apart
I dare to dream for there you are
I bleed, but I won't break

I saw the light today (x3) ... today, today...
