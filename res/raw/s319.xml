Unsealed
On a porch a letter sat
Then you said I want to leave it again

Once I saw him
On a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I want to leave it again

On a weekend want to wish it all way
And they called an I said an I want what
I said an I call out again

And the reason oughta leave her calm I know
I said I know what I wear that a box or the bag

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay

Make me cry

I see
I don't know there's something else
I want to drum it all away
An I said
I said "I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag"

Oh yeah can you see them?
Out on the porch
Ah, but they don't wave
I see them
Round the front way, yeah
And I know and I know
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
