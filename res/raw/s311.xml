    <lyrics>
I'm questioning my education
is my education who I am now?
while you're deciding, I've been finding
looking around in the here and now
if I've been taught from the beginning
would my fears now by winning?

I'm questioning my own equation
is my own equation relevant somehow?
the flags are waving, the news is breaking
see the man who can't pick out his own tie
if I've been taught from the beginning
would my fears now be winning?
a wild world, figuring out the answers
I'll be in my own dance and iiii...

I'm questioning my education
rewind and what does it show?
could be, the truth it becomes you
I'm a seed, wondering why it grows
