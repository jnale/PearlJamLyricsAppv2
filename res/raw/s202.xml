    <lyrics>
I wished for so long...
I cannot stay
All the precious moments...
Cannot stay
Its not like wings have fallen...
I cannot say
Still something is missing...
I cannot say

Holding hands of daughters and sons
In their phase theyre falling down
Down, down, down

I have wished for so long...
How I wish for you today

Will I walk the long road? 
I cannot stay
Theres no need to say goodbye

Oh, the friends and family...
All the memories going round
Round, round round...

I have wished for so long...
How I wished for you today

And the wind keeps rollin
And the sky keeps turning grey
And the sun is set
The sun will rise another day

I have wished for so long...
How I wish for you today

I have wished for so long...
How I wish for you today
Will I walk the long road? 
We all walk the long road
