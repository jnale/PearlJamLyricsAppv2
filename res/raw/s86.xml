    <lyrics>
It's a disease,... and they're all green
It emanates from their being
A satiation,.. with occupation

And like weeds,.. with big leaves
Stealing light from what's beneath
Where they have more,...
Still they take more

Course I know,.. then I don't
There's a stowaway with my throat
It's deceiving...
I don't believe him

We can scream,.. out our doors
Behind the wall a fat man snores
In his dreams he's,...
Choking till leaves

Well I guess
There's nothing wrong with what you say
But don't sell me,
'There can't be better ways'

Tell the captain
'This boats not safe
And we're drowning.'
Turns out
He's the one making waves

I said
There's nothing wrong with what you say
Believe me
Just asking you to sway
No white
Or black
Just grey
Can you feel this...
World with your heart and not your brain?

G-R-E-E-D..... G-R-E-E-D
