    <lyrics>
Seen it happen to a couple of friends...
See it happen and the message it sends...
Taking off for what's an obvious fall...
Just to see what all the fuss is about...

It's not your way...Not your way... It's not your way

Another habit says it's in love with you...
Another habit says its love's overdue...
Another habit like an unwanted friend...
I'm so happy with my righteous self...

It's not your way...Not your way... It's not your way

Never thought you'd habit...

Speaking as an individual who will see the year 2000

Never thought you'd habit...
Never me...never you...never me.
